<h1> Code Comb's Android-API </h1>
since I have to implement all kind of things for android for my college these past term, from Robot-Vision with OpenCV to a simple Shopping-Application,
I found out that mostly it is very helpful to come up with an own simple API for some things.<br>
<br>
Well of course I wouldn't want to keep these kind of things for me alone, what this repository is there for. <br>
<br>
Before using any part of this API I would like you to read this one advice I want to give you, or write me a message if you have any kind of problems with it:<br>

<ul>
  <li> I am a college student, I have started implementing for Android roughtly 2 months ago </li>
	<li> any of these API parts might contain some bugs, if you find any let me know (or if you want any added features, or see point 3) </li>
	<li> this API is open to be rewritten, copied or used in any way you want, so feel free to upgrade it anyway you want </li>
</ul>
With that being said, I wish you a lot of fun implementing!<br>
sincerely David Riedl from Code Comb
